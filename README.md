## Little Backstory

I made it as a diploma project when I was studying in Printing and Publishing college.

When I made it, I had little knowledge about programming, only tons of enthusiasm. I wanted to make a game no matter what. This is why I decided to completely rewrite it using the new knowledge I gained.

All the texts in the game are written in Russian. I plan to make an English version in the future.
